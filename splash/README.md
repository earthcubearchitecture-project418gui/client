# Earthcube Architecture Project418gui/client - ISTI 
Client directory contains all the components that need to be present (in a web-server hosted directory) to implement the GUI web app to facilitate editting JSON-LD script blocks in user-friendly fashion.
It relies upon just a few external libraries and/or CSS files which are included in the directory rather than being referenced from somewhere like google cache.

jquery-3.3.1.js
jquery-ui.js
jquery-ui.css
jquery-confirm.min.js
font-awesome-4.7.0/css/font-awesome.min.css

currently (2/8/2019) the two master schema files that are used to construct the UI are fond in this directory
organizations.json and dataset.json
